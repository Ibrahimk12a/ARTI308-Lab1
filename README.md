# ARTI308-Lab1
In this lab, I established the technical foundation for managing software projects by mastering Version Control Systems using Git and GitHub. I learned to utilize Git for tracking local changes through snapshots and GitHub for remote hosting and collaboration. The session also covered essential terminal commands for file management and the standard Git workflow, including initializing repositories, staging changes, and committing updates. Furthermore, I applied these skills to organize my university assignments by structuring this lab as a sub-repository within the main course project.
